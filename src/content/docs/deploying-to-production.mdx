## Getting started

Make sure you followed the documentation until here, if you haven't, go back.

### Building

```shell
bun run build && cd web && bun run build
```

### Starting Aethel

You don't need to start the frontend, Aethel automatically serves the Frontend.

```sh
cd .. && bun run start
```

### Discord Developers Portal Setup

Now, you need to setup your bot in the Discord Developers Portal.

Go to the Discord Developers Portal, select your Discord Bot, and navigate to the Installation Tab.

Make sure that both User Install and Guild install are checked off, then scroll down.

For Guild Installs, make sure you have the `application.commands` and `bot` scopes set. Without the `bot` scope, you won't be able to install Aethel in your server, and without the User Install checked off, you won't be able to install Aethel in your account.

Now, navigate to the Bot tab, scroll down until you see "Privileged Gateway Intents"

Enable all of them, if you don't enable all the Gateway Intents, Aethel will not work correctly or at all.



### Start the bot

Now, you are safe to start Aethel and install it in your account or server!

```
bun run start
```
